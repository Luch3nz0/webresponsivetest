first project using html5, CSS and Javascript
Newbie coder! started my journey in coding so I can excute a lot of ideas I've always had but didn't have the technical skills to do so, one step at a time, but enjoying this brave new AI world which boost our learning and productivity if well used. In this file my project is a RPG game I'm learning in a online course in FreeCodeCamp. Also I want to learn Git fundamentals, and the best way to do so is using it!
